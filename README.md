#ML bbject recognition

Here I have made a simple object recognition game where you can check whether the object is a controller or a Rubik's cube. (These were the first objects I had on my desk, so that's why such random objects.

Disclaimer: It does not work perfectly, as it was only trained on 1 kind of Rubik's cube and controller. All other objects will be recognized either as a Rubik's cube or a controller.
